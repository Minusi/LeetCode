<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/?envType=study-plan&id=data-structure-ii">119. Pascal's Triangle II</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr>Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

 
Example 1:
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Example 2:
Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
Example 3:
Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]

 
Constraints:


	0 <= rowIndex <= 33


 
Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?
